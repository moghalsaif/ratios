            <p>From compound interest to first principle thinking, every so-called big problem ends up being a set of small problems stacked together.</p>
            <p>Decisions stake up the same way.</p>
            <p>Every decision you make opens a door for a new set of decisions that also means every decision you make today was dependent upon what decision you made yesterday.</p>
          <p>Knowing which second door your decision unlocks is crucial</p>
          <p>You might make the best decision in a situation now but you also have to make a decision to be in a situation to make the best decision.</p>
          <p>It's not a puzzle, all you need to do is to understand what decisions in past has led you to be in this situation to make a decision now and can you change the past decision and get into a new situation, this unlocks new decisions for you.</p>
